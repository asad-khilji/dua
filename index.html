    <p>It was narrated from Ayesha (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) taught her this supplication:</p><br>

    <p>O Allah, I ask You for all that is good, in this world and in the Hereafter, what I know and what I do not know.</p> 

    <p>O Allah, I seek refuge with You from all evil, in this world and in the Hereafter, what I know and what I do not know.</p> 

    <p>O Allah, I ask You for the good that Your slave and Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) has asked You for, and I seek refuge with You from the evil from which Your slave and Prophet sought refuge.</p>

    <p> O Allah, I ask You for Paradise and for that which brings one closer to it, in word and deed, and I seek refuge in You from Hell and from that which brings one closer to it, in word and deed.</p>

    <p> And I ask You to make every decree that You decree concerning me good.</p><br>

    <p>Narrated by Ahmad in his Musnad (24498) and Ibn Maajah in his Sunan (3846). Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami (1276).</p>
